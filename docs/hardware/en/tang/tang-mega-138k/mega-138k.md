## Overview

  Tang Mega 138K uses a 22nm process **GW5AST-LV138PG484A** FPGA chip, which has 138,240 lookup table units and nearly 300 DSP units. It contains eight high-speed transceivers with a speed range of 270Mbps ~ 6.6Gbps, suitable for transmitting data through high-speed ports such as PCIe. In addition, the chip contains a hard-core PCIe, which consumes better resources when using PCIe and achieves better performance. It is suitable for high-speed communication, protocol conversion, high-performance computing, and other occasions.
  
  Compared to the 138K Pro Dock, the 138K Dock has a smaller size and a lower price, and it replaces the SFP transceiver with USB3 SS(5Gbps). This not only effectively reduces the cost of high-speed communication but also brings better versatility.

## Getting Started

Note that 138K is currently not supported by the education version, and you need to download V1.9.9 or a newer version of the commercial IDE for use.  
Lic can be applied on the Gowin official website, or you can use the online Lic service provided by Sipeed. In the IDE, select Float Lic and fill in the following information:

~~~
ip: 106.55.34.119
port: 10559
~~~

if the ip not work, try use "gowinlic.sipeed.com" domain's IP.

Tang Mega 138K can meet different needs of customers in various scenarios. For technical support and business cooperation, please contact [support@sipeed.com](support@sipeed.com)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### After powering on the board, only four indicator lights on the dockboard are on, the SOM indicator light is not on

1. Please check if the boardâ€™s power has been turned on, press and hold the PWR button (next to the HDMI port) for 2 seconds to turn on the power.

### After powering on the board, the Battery-Indicator light on the dcokboard is flashing

1. This is normal behavior, usually, the last LED (near the 12V DC connector) is flashing;
2. When the board is connected to a 3.7V lithium battery, these LEDs will serve as battery level indicators.

### After pressing and holding the PWR button for 2 seconds, all the indicator lights on the dockboard turn off and then light up in sequence

1. Check your power supply method, this situation means that the power supply is insufficient;
2. Solutions (choose one):
    a. Connect both the boardâ€™s **USB-3.0** and **USB-DEBUG** for power supply, i.e., dual 5V USB power supply; 
    b. Connect a 12V DC power supply to the board, if using the USB-C to 12V DC connector from the accessories, a PD power source with 12V output capability is required;
    c. Connect a 3.7V lithium battery to power the board, note that the battery voltage must be â‰¥3.6V and the continuous discharge capacity must be â‰¥600mA.

### IDE cannot find the model GW5AST-LV138PG484A

1. The educational version does not support 138K, please switch to the commercial version. The following image shows the educational version (which does not support 138K);
<img src="../assets/questions/no_model_in_IDE.png" width="35%">

2. IDE version is too low to use, update the IDE version â‰¥ **1.9.9**.

### How to burn the bitstream to FLASH {#burn_flash}

1. Setting the **Programmer** as shown in the figure below:

<img src="./assets/flash_mode.png" alt="flash_mode" width=35%>

2. Check the position of the DIP switch; the correct position is shown in the figure below:

<img src="./assets/dip-key_defualt.png" alt="dip-key_defualt" width=35%>

### No Response or Undesirable Pin Phenomenon After Burning

1. First, ensure that the IDE has selected the correct model **GW5AST-LV138PG484AC1/10**; every parameter in the figure below **MUST** be consistent.

<img src="./assets/partno_138K.png" alt="device_choose" width=35%>

2. Then, check your code and the corresponding simulation waveforms to meet the requirements. The GAO tools in GOWIN IDE maybe helpful. For more information, please refer to the GOWIN document [SUG100](https://www.gowinsemi.com/upload/database_doc/1885/document/660bb2366d0b3.pdf)(require login).
